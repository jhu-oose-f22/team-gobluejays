## Problem Statement: A few sentences to describe the problem you are trying to solve, i.e., justify why this software is needed.

There're numerous web and mobile applications supporting students' life in JHU, yet functions of every application are too discrete so that students have to switch among various applications, which is inconvenient. For daily communication, course information, and academic resources, students would use a variety of apps at the same time, including Slack, Teams, Piazza, and SIS. Not to mention applications for school life like TransLoc, Hop-Rec, etc.

Moreover, it also paves a new way to improve upon the flaws in the existing applications used by JHU students, which are stated below:
- Current JHU calendar application, Smesterly, does not have a mobile version, and details of courses, like where to submit assignments and when to take a midterm-exam, could not be added and showed in calendars.
- CampusGrpup is the only application where students can obtain information about campus events. However, it has a poor UI design and only allows students to view and register activities. Students won't be notified or even recommended if they don't voluntarily go to the page and check the activity list.

## Potential Clients: Who are influenced by this problem and would benefit from the proposed solution? (i.e. the potential users)
-JHU Students
-Students across different college campuses

## Proposed Solution: Write a few sentences that describe how a software solution will solve the problem described above.
There will be four pages on our mobile application: home, calendar, activity, and setting.

We aim to provide students with an integrated hub that incorporates all the websites and applications that Hopkins provides in order to help students better manage cross-platform information and resources. This feature will be implemented on the homepage, where different applications are aggregated and grouped under the same section that are easily accessible. Users could use by clicking the icons and our app would redirect to the specific website.

Our calendar could extract the student course schedule from SIS so students could also view that with our app. More importantly, students can add other events as well as detailed descriptions and notes to each time slots according to their needs.

On the activity page, different events will be displayed clearly with picture, event title, location, and time. Students can view and collect events, and get recommended based on their schedule and location.

In short, while acting as a resource hub, our app will help Hopkins students achieve a better work-life balance by providing a comprehensive calendar function for managing work schedule as well as a user-friendly activity center for exploring various campus events.

## Functional Requirements: List the (functional) requirements that software needs to have in order to solve the problem stated above. List these in role-goal-benefit format. It is useful to try to group the requirements into those that are essential (must have), and those which are non-essential (but nice to have).

## Software Architecture & Technology Stack: Will this be a Web/desktop/mobile (all, or some other kind of) application? Would it conform to specific software architecture? What programming languages, frameworks, databases, …, will be used to develop and deploy the software?
GoBlueJays is a mobile app that conforms to iOS Mobile Application Architecture with the MVC model (Model-View-Controller):
- Model – The data layer (persistence, model objects, parsers, managers, networking code).
- View – Similar to the presentation layer, a re-usable layer that represents the app to the user.
- Controller – A mediator level that communicates with an abstraction via a protocol.

The app is built and run on Xcode. We use Swift as our major programming language and SQLite for databases.

## Similar Apps: List a few similar applications to the one you are developing. Don't be eager to conclude no similar app exists! There is always something similar to what you are building! Finding those will help you to better specify your project. You must be prepared to explain how your app is different from the existing ones.
