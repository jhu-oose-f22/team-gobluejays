# What you had done in iteration 1
- Made final decision on the core functionalities of the project, replace to do list with event recommandation
- Design multiple user interface for the core features
- Focus on delivering the following “must have” user stories: 
1. Access school apps and websites: as a user of the app, I want to access to or be directed to different campus apps and websites, such as TransLoc, SIS, and Canvas, so that I can enjoy various services and obtain different information easily from an integrated platform.
2. Add to schedule: as a user of the app, I want to make my own schedule including adding all the courses and my personal events so that I can check them out conveniently on the app.
3. Collect campus events: as a user of the app, I want to be able to collect the events that I'm interested in so that I can access their details conveniently.
4. Setting page: as a user, when I log in, there should be a setting page containing my personal profile information and have access to project document and support.

# Things that you have and have not delivered
- have delivered
1. designed and coded the basic framework for schedule, events, and settings page using Figma
2. fully completed home page implementation on seperate branch, ready to be merged
3. setup a Realm database using MongoDB

- have not delivered
1. connect and upload locally stored data to the database
2. make user interface responsive
3. build datailed front-end implementation for schedule and activity tabs

# The challenges you had
- Improve the app design to better fit project requirements in limited time
- Came up with a beyond CRUD feature and coded the basic structure before deadline
- Make design decision on improving user interface and experience to make the app user-friendy and handy

# Reflect on how you shall proceed in the next iteration to do a better job
- keep project board up-tp-date and divide targeted user story in individual tasks
- discuss the to-do list with TA ahead of time to make sure we stay on track
