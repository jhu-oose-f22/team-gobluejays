6. Add event: set up a comprehensive add event page interface

# The challenges you had
- merge failure when trying to combine features on different branches
- Parsing date and duration information to fit into schedule page while keeping the interface mobile friendly on multiple iphone models

- Determine top user needs and renovate add event page from scratch

# Reflect on how you shall proceed in the next iteration to do a better job
- Merge branches sooner before deadline
