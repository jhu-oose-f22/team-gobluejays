# What you had done in iteration 4
Focus on delivering the following “must have” user stories: 
1. Schedule Page: Add courses to the schedule by course number. Users will need manually enter course numbers
2. View Activity: add details, jump to detail page after click
3. Add-Event: Fix location error, enable event detail view and delete
5. View Activity: add details from parsed ics
6. Activity Recommendation: recommend activity based on user preference, collection
7. View Activity: parse most information about activities from CampusGroups

# Things that you have and have not delivered
- have delivered
1. Add course by course number and section, delete course
2. Parse activities from campusgroups
3. Fix add event location error, user can add location to the specific event
4. Display event detail page on click and enable event delete
5. Recommand activity algorithm based on user collection
6. Add details to the activity display page from parsed ics

- have not delivered
1. display image from url (currently using blank images for all activities, will replace in next iteration)
2. an error handler for add course functionality when user input malformed course number

# The challenges you had
- deleting an instance from firebase collection
- parsing data from calendar objects using python
- fetching course detail data by course number

# Reflect on how you shall proceed in the next iteration to do a better job
- Merge branches sooner before deadline
- Focus on must-have user stories first
